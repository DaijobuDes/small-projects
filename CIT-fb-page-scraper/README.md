## One big note

ðŸŸ¥ Please run only one instance of the script or you will be temporarily banned by facebook.

ðŸŸ¥ You might get IP banned by doing this. Run at your own risk.

### What's this all about?

This script scrapes the posts of CIT - University's Facebook Page
and all posts' text will be relayed to discord by using discord's webhook functionality.
The script fetches data for every 5 minutes, unless an exception might occur, time will increase 
by one minute with a maximum time of 10 minutes.

### Why did I create this?

The reason why I created this is because I want to ease the access of 
reading posts through discord instead of going to facebook's site, in which I do not
like anymore due to the new UI that they implemented some months ago. Really, I miss the 
old facebook's look.

### Notes also

Since discord has a text limit of 2000 characters, this script only gets the first 500 characters it 
finds on the post and appends the link to the post in order to continue reading. (and to be less spammy of course)
